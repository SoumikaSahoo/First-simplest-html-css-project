# Dentytech Landing Page

This is my very first project using just **HTML** and **CSS** basics.  
I created a clean, modern landing page for a dental tech concept called **Dentytech**.

The page includes:
- A bold hero section
- Stacked image layout
- “Advanced Technology” label with a circular settings icon
- Simple, responsive design
